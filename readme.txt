Responsive navigation system for use with the Genesis framework.

== Description ==

This plugin uses WordPress custom menus added in version 3.0. 
It requires that you use the Genesis theme framework.
Genesis Responsive Menu only displays the submenu for the currently active top level item, using CSS.
It is much like the navigation from starbucks.com.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin folder to your wp-content/plugins directory, or install it through the admin interface.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
